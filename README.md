# C-CHVAE-Pytorch

Counterfactual explanation is the meaningful and minimum perturbation for an input that can alter the original prediction by a machine learning model, usually from an undesirable prediction to a desirable one. In this repo, I plan to reproduce the implementation of C-CHVAE [WWW2020](https://github.com/MartinPawel/c-chvae) on PyTorch platform. The official implementation works on Tensorflow.  Thanks for Martin providing the test file to me which help me understand the algorithms.
